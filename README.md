# Password Checker

## Description

Write a program that verifies that a given password is secure, i.e. that it conforms to the following corporate standards for passwords:

* has a length of 8 to 16 characters
* contains at least 2 digits
* contains at least 2 uppercase letters and at least 2 lowercase letters
* contains at least 1 of the following _special_ characters: {!, @, #, $, ^, &, ?, <, >}

If a password does not meet any of the above requirements, your program should list the rule or rules that are not satisfied.

For Ruby, write your program to prompt the user for the password. You can use the following to protect the secrecy of the password:

```ruby
require 'io/console'

print 'Please enter your password: '
password = STDIN.noecho(&:gets).chomp
```

> Hint: Ruby strings have a `count` method that you may find helpful, see [count](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html#method-i-count)
